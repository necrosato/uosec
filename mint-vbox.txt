If you would like to set up a VirtualBox image on your own, here are the instructions. I can help you with this tomorrow if you’d like, but I don’t want to waste your time if you feel capable.

First things first, we need to download and verify our image.

To download:
1. Go to https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=249 
2. Click on one of the USA mirror links. I used the first one, advancedhosters.com. The download should begin automatically to your ~/Downloads/ folder.
3. Go to https://linuxmint.com/verify.php
4. Find sha256sum.txt, right click and ‘Download Linked File’. This should place it in ~/Downloads/.

To Verify:
1. Open a fresh terminal window. The following lines preceded by ‘$’ are terminal commands. I will explain each command.
2. $ cd ~/Downloads
	this takes you to your Downloads
3. $ mkdir ISO
	this makes a new directory called ISO
4. $ mv sha256sum.txt* ISO
	this places both sha256sum.txt in ISO
5. $ mv linuxmint-18.3-xfce-64bit.iso ISO
	this places the image in the ISO folder
6. $ cd ISO
7. $ shasum -a 256 -b *.iso
	this will generate a crazy line
8. $ cat sha256sum.txt
	this will print 8 crazy lines, one should match

To Install in VirtualBox:
1. Launch VirtualBox
2. Click the ‘New’ button (in the top left on mine).
3. Set Name to ‘Mint’.
4. Set Type to ‘Linux’.
5. Set Version to ‘Ubuntu (64-bit)’.
6. Set Memory size to 2048 MB
7. Set Hard disk to ‘Create a virtual hard disk now’.
8. Create
Now in terminal:
9. $ mv linuxmint-18.3-xfce-64bit.iso ~/VirtualBox\ VMs/Mint/
	this places the .iso in the VirutalBox folder
Back in VirtualBox
10. Right-Click the Mint vm, select ‘Settings’.
11. Click on ‘Storage on the top bar’
12. Select the empty slot under ‘Controller: IDE’.
13. On the side, change ‘IDE Secondary Master’ to ‘IDE Primary Master’
14. Click the disk icon next to that and select the image
15. Ok
16. Start
In the virtual machine:
1. Double click ‘Install Linux Mint’.
2. Continue, Continue, Install Now, Continue
3. Select Time Zone & Keyboard
4. Fill out credentials you want to use
