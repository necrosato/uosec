1. 
    Download Kali Linux:
        https://www.kali.org/downloads/
    Check SHA256SUMS && SHA256SUMS.gpg:
        brew install gpg
        Get SHA256SUMS && SHA256SUMS.gpg:
            http://cdimage.kali.org/current/ 
        
        Verify: (from https://www.kali.org/downloads/ )

            $ wget -q -O - https://www.kali.org/archive-key.asc | gpg --import
          # or...
            $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 7D8D0BF6
          # ...and verify that the displayed fingerprint matches the one below
            $ gpg --fingerprint 7D8D0BF6
            pub   rsa4096 2012-03-05 [SC] [expires: 2021-02-03]
                  44C6 513A 8E4F B3D3 0875  F758 ED44 4FF0 7D8D 0BF6
            uid           [ unknown] Kali Linux Repository <devel@kali.org>
            sub   rsa4096 2012-03-05 [E] [expires: 2021-02-03]

            Once you have downloaded both SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.gpg, you can verify the signature as follows:

            $ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS
            gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Feb 2018 03:33:53 AM EST
            gpg:                using RSA key 44C6513A8E4FB3D30875F758ED444FF07D8D0BF6
            gpg: Good signature from "Kali Linux Repository <devel@kali.org>" [unknown]
            gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
            gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
            Primary key fingerprint: 44C6 513A 8E4F B3D3 0875  F758 ED44 4FF0 7D8D 0BF6
            
            If you don’t get that “Good signature” message or if the key ID doesn’t match, then you should stop the process and review whether you downloaded the images from a legitimate Kali mirror.
